Secrets engines in Vault are components which store, generate, or encrypt data.

The kv secrets engine is used to store arbitrary secrets within the
configured physical storage for Vault. +
Key names must always be strings.



Let set kv engine version2.

Now we can do simple kv secret manipulation:

----

  vault secrets enable -version=2 kv

  vault kv put kv/my-secret my-value=s3cr3t


  vault kv list   kv/

----
